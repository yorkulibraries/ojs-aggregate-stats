# Usage
#
# First set up these environment variables, either on the comamnd line
# or in your .bashrc.
#
# $ export OJS_ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
# $ export OJS_ADMIN_PASSWORD=secret
#
# Specify the month with -d:
#
# $ ./aggregate-ojs-download-stats.sh -d 201701 > ojs-downloads-201701.csv
#
# Use GNU date to get the previous month (good for cron jobs):
#
# $ PREV_MONTH=`date -d '1 month ago' "+%Y%m"`
# $ ./aggregate-ojs-download-stats.sh -d $PREV_MONTH > ojs-downloads-$PREV_MONTH.csv

# List of journal stats report URLs
#
# These are stored in a CSV file.
#
# It has to be organized like this (for York) because each part of the URL stored in the array has _slight_ differences
# (usually related to the journal number it was assigned in our previous installation). What this means is that I
# couldn't use one common URL with only the journal name changing. So whenever we need to add a journal to the code,
# just scroll to the bottom and follow the pattern with the next variable index.
#
# Note for URLs, we used to have a single OJS installation with many journals (which is why they all have a number). We
# have now moved to having a single OJS installation for every journal. I imagine that if you started with multiple OJS
# installations, you might actually have a uniform beginning URL.

JOURNAL_LIST="ojs-journals.csv"

# OJS admin username and password
#
# It's safest to set these up as environment variables,
# but if they're not there, ask for them.

# This variable is because the last part of the URL is uniform and just makes life easier to construct the URL with the
