#So... the longest part of this code is obviously the variables. I organized the variable declarations by putting the two arrays with similar indices one after another. There are two variables: $journal_name and $url. My hope is that this will ensure that there is always a one-to-one correspondence between the journal and the URL for generating the report.

#It has to be organized like this (for York) because each part of the URL stored in the array has _slight_ differences (usually related to the journal number it was assigned in our previous installation). What this means is that I couldn't use one common URL with only the $journal_name changing. So whenever we need to add a journal to the code, just scroll to the bottom and follow the pattern with the next variable index.

#Note for URLs, we used to have a single OJS installation with many journals (which is why they all have a number). We have now moved to having a single OJS installation for every journal. I imagine that if you started with multiple OJS installations, you might actually have a uniform beginning URL. If so, there are other ways to declare bash arrays.

#this variable is because the last part of the URL is uniform and just makes life easier to construct the URL with the 'start' ($url); 'middle' ($month); 'end' ($last). No idea if this would be different on a different server installation. Replace with whatever comes after the date range in the URL -- if uniform.

#This combines the two tmp files generated above and combines them into the final report. Even if you are using this to aggregate a different type of custom report, this should be fine, since it grabs the last line.

#The resulting CSV will be in the same directory as the script, with all additional files in the tmp directory. Obviously, this assumes a *nix computing environment, since I have no idea where the tmp directory is on Windows (or Macs, if not the same). The easiest way to change this would be to make the path the current directory.
